            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">What is a Dispute?</h2>
            <p>A dispute, in the context of HelpRush, is defined as any disagreement or conflict between a customer and a service provider or a customer and a service professional (Service Pro) on our platform. Disputes may arise from various situations, including but not limited to issues related to services rendered, payment disputes, or any other matter affecting the parties involved in a transaction.</p>

            <p>Our goal is to provide a fair and transparent process for resolving disputes, ensuring that both customers and service providers understand the steps involved and the mechanisms in place for resolution. This document outlines the procedures and timelines for resolving disputes, emphasizing informal resolution, mediation, and escalation to HelpRush.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">HelpRushâ€™s Role:</h2>
            <p>HelpRush is an online services aggregator and only offers an online marketplace for providers and users to transact. HelpRush doesn't provide services directly to users through its employees or associates, hence is not legally a party to any dispute involving service providers and customers. Providers are independent contractors and are fully responsible for their service, conduct, job, etc. Our role is to facilitate connections and transactions between customers and providers, promoting a reliable and efficient platform. While we strive to ensure a positive experience, any disputes regarding the actual services provided should be directed to the responsible service provider.</p>
